# Hypixel SkyBlock - HarpCliker
A mod that helps you complete all levels on the harp, obtain a talisman, and receive other bonuses. When you open the harp, it activates automatically and completes the mini-game for you. It's just a script, it presses buttons for you, and you **CANNOT** get banned on Hypixel for that.

The mod itself determines when a song is played and works completely independently.

**IMPORTANT**: Once you have opened the harp and the song has started playing, do not touch the keyboard or mouse; everything will be done automatically for you.
